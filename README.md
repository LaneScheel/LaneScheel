ðŸ‘‹ Greetings 
------

My name is @LaneScheel, and I'm an aspiring Gravitational Wave Astrophysicist! ðŸ”­

-----

- I currently attend Valparaiso University, where I'm pursuing a __B.S. of Physics and Mathematics w/ Honors__ ðŸ“–
  
- My latest research is in efficient Binary Black Hole parameter estimation using LIGO data and ML techniques ðŸ‘¾

- Hailing from rural Wisconsin, I love hiking, fishing, wildlife photography, and all things outdoors ðŸŒ³

-----

My previous research includes: 
- Simulation of thermal effects in advanced laser interferometers using the FINESSE software
- Modeling of gravitational waves emmited by eccentric binary white dwarf systems
- Calculating Signal-to-Noise ratios for these ^^^ detections in the Laser Interferomter Space Antennae (LISA)
- Modeling of close envelope binary star systems in with the PHOEBE software
- AstroChemical binding energies of simple molecules and interstellar ice/dust grains

-----

I am seeking admission to a PhD program in Gravitational Physics for the Fall of 2025. ðŸŽ“

Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions! ðŸš€
